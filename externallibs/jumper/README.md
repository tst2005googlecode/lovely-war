﻿#Jumper#

__Jumper__ is a pathfinding library designed for __uniform-cost 2D grid-based__ games featuring [Jump Point Search][] algorithm.<br/>
__Jumper__ is (very) fast, lightweight and generates almost no memory overhead. As such, it might be an interesting option
for pathfinding computation on 2D maps.
Plus, *Jumper* offers a clean API which makes it very friendly and easy-to-use.<br/>

__Jumper__ is written in pure [Lua][]. Thus, it is not __framework-related__ and can be used in __any project__ embedding [Lua][] code.

##Files##

* [Jumper][] contains the library itself.
* [Jumper_(Demo).love][] | [Jumper_(Demo).rar][] is a visual interactive demo.
* [Jumper_(Tests).love][] | [Jumper_(Tests).rar][] is another demo which performs a set of benchmark tests.
  
##Usage##

Place the folder [Jumper][] inside your projet. Use *require* to load it.

    local Jumper = require('Jumper.init')

*Note : If your LUA path includes search for "init.lua" on folder opening, as [Löve][] Framework do, you can simply use: require('Jumper')*

Now you must now setup a 2D matrix of __integers__ or __strings__ representing your world. Values stored in this matrix
should represent whether or not a cell on the matrix is walkable or not. If you choose for instance
*0* for walkable tiles, __any other value__ will be considered as non walkable.

    local map = {
          {0,0,0},
          {0,2,0},
          {0,0,1},
          }

To initialize the pathfinder, you will have to pass __four values__. 

    local walkable = 0
    local allowDiagonal = true
    local pather = Jumper(map,walkable,allowDiagonal,heuristic)
  
Only the first argument is __required__, the __three others__ left are __optional__.
* __map__ refers to the matrix representing the 2D world.
* __walkable__ refers to the value representing walkable tiles. Will be considered as *0* if not given.
* __allowDiagonal__ is a boolean saying whether or not diagonal moves are allowed. Will be considered as __true__ if not given.
* __heuristic__ is a predefined constant representing the heuristic function to be used for path computation.

##Distance heuristics##

*Jumper* features 4 types of distance heuristics.

* MANHATTAN Distance : <em>|dx| + |dy|</em>
* EUCLIDIAN Distance : <em>sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)</em>
* DIAGONAL Distance : <em>max(|dx|, |dy|)</em>
* CHEBYSHEV Distance : <em>DIAGONAL(dx,dy)</em>

Each of these distance heuristics are packed inside Jumper's core. By default, when initializing  *Jumper*, __MANHATTAN__ Distance is used if 
no heuristic was specified.<br/>
If you need to use __another distance heuristic__, you will need to __require all distance heuristics__ first.
All distance heuristics are defined inside [heuristics.lua][].

    local walkable = 0
    local allowDiagonal = true
    local Heuristics. = require 'Jumper.core.heuristics'
    local Jumper = require('Jumper.init')
    local pather = Jumper(map,walkable,allowDiagonal,Heuristics.EUCLIDIAN)

You can __alternatively__ use *setHeuristic(Name)*. This way, __requiring distance heuristics is no more relevant__.
The __heuristic name__ to be passed to *setHeuristic()* method must be one of these following, with quotes:

* __"MANHATTAN"__ (referring to MANHATTAN Distance)
* __"EUCLIDIAN"__ (referring to EUCLIDIAN Distance)
* __"DIAGONAL"__ or __"CHEBYSHEV"__ (referring to DIAGONAL Distance)

As an example :
 
    local walkable = 0
    local allowDiagonal = true
    local Jumper = require('Jumper.init')
    local pather = Jumper(map,walkable,allowDiagonal)
    pather:setheuristic('EUCLIDIAN')

##API##

###Main Pathfinder Class API

Once loaded and initialized properly, you can now used one of the following methods listed below.<br/>
__Assuming *pather* represents an instance of *Jumper* class.__
	
####pather:setHeuristic(NAME)
Will change the heuristic to be used.<br/>
__NAME__ must be passed as a string.<br/>
Possible values are __"MANHATTAN"__,__"EUCLIDIAN"__,__"DIAGONAL"__,__"CHEBYSHEV"__ (case-sensitive!).
* __Argument NAME__: a string
* __Returns:__ Nothing

####pather:getHeuristic() 
Will return a reference to the __heuristic function__ internally used.<br/>
* __Argument__: Nothing
* __Returns:__ a function

####pather:setDiagonalMoves(Bool)
Argument must be a boolean. __true__ will authorize __diagonal moves__, __false__ will allow __only straight-moves__.<br/>
* __Argument Bool__: a boolean
* __Returns:__ Nothing

####pather:getDiagonalMoves()
Returns __a boolean__ saying whether or not diagonal moves are allowed.
* __Argument__: Nothing
* __Returns:__ a boolean

####pather:getGrid()
Returns a reference to the __internal grid__ used by the pathfinder.
This grid is __not__ the map matrix given on initialization, but a __virtual representation__ used internally.
* __Argument__: Nothing
* __Returns:__ a grid (regular Lua table)

####pather:searchPath(startX,startY,endX,endY)
Main function, returns a path from [startX,startY] to [endX,endY] as an __ordered array__ of locations ({x = ...,y = ...}).
Otherwise returns __nil__ if there is __no valid path__.
Also returns a __second value__ representing __total cost of the move__ if a path was found.
* __Argument startX__: The X coordinate of the starting node (positive non zero integer)
* __Argument startY__: The Y coordinate of the starting node (positive non zero integer)
* __Argument endX__: The X coordinate of the goal node (positive non zero integer)
* __Argument endY__: The Y coordinate of the goal node (positive non zero integer)
* __Returns:__ a path (regular Lua table) or nil
* __Returns:__ the path cost (positive number) or nil

####pather:smooth(Path)
Polishes a path
* __Argument Path__: a path (regular Lua table)
* __Returns:__ a path (regular Lua table)

###Grid Class API

Using *getGrid()* returns a reference to the internal grid used by the pathfinder.
On this reference, you can use one of the following methods.<br/>
__Assuming *grid* holds the return value from *pather:getGrid()*__

####grid:getNodeAt(x,y)
Returns a reference to the node (X,Y) on the grid.

* __Argument x__: the X coordinate of the requested node (positive non zero integer)
* __Argument y__: the Y coordinate of the requested node (positive non zero integer)
* __Returns:__ a node (regular Lua table)

####grid:isWalkableAt(x,y)
Returns a boolean saying whether or not the node (X,Y) __exists on the grid and is walkable__.
* __Argument x__: the X coordinate of the requested node (positive non zero integer)
* __Argument y__: the Y coordinate of the requested node (positive non zero integer)
* __Returns:__ a boolean

####grid:setWalkableAt(x,y,boolean)
Sets the node (X,Y) __walkable or not__ depending on the boolean given.
__true__ makes the node walkable, while __false__ makes it unwalkable.
* __Argument x__: the X coordinate of the requested node (positive non zero integer)
* __Argument y__: the Y coordinate of the requested node (positive non zero integer)
* __Argument boolean__: a boolean
* __Returns:__ Nothing

####grid:getNeighbours(node,allowDiagonal)

The list will include or not adjacent nodes regards to the boolean __allowDiagonal__.
* __Argument node__: a node (regular Lua table)
* __Argument allowDiagonal__: a boolean
* __Returns:__ list of neighbours (regular Lua table)

####grid:reset()
Resets the grid. Called internally before each path computation, should not be used explicitely.
* __Argument__: Nothing
* __Returns:__ Nothing
 
##Handling paths##

###Using native *searchPath()* method###

Using *searchPath()* will return a table representing a path from one node to another.<br/>
The path is stored in a table using the form given below:

    path = {
              {x = 1,y = 1},
              {x = 2,y = 2},
              {x = 3,y = 3},
              ...
              {x = n,y = n},
            }
			
You will have to make your own use of this to __route your entities__ on the 2D map along this path.<br/>
Note that the path could contains some *holes* because of the algorithm used.<br/>
However, this should not cause a serious issue as the move from one step to another along the path is always straight.
You can accomodate of this by yourself, or use the __path smoother__.

###Using the path smoother###

__Jumper__ provides a __path smoother__ that can be used to polish a path early computed, filling the holes it may contain.
As it directly alters the path given, both of these syntax works:

    local walkable = 0
    local allowDiagonal = true
    local Jumper = require('Jumper.init')
    -- Assuming map is defined
    local pather = Jumper(map,walkable,allowDiagonal)
    local path, length = pather:searchPath(1,1,3,3)
    -- Capturing the returned value
    path = pather:smooth(path)
	
  
    local walkable = 0
    local allowDiagonal = true
    local Jumper = require('Jumper.init')
    -- Assuming map is defined
    local pather = Jumper(map,walkable,allowDiagonal)
    local path, length = pather:searchPath(1,1,3,3)
    -- Just passing the path to the smoother.
    pather:smooth(path)
	
##Known Issues##

* __Straight moves__ : you may find paths with only straight moves allowed somewhat odd under some circumstances (too much zigzags). This is something I am aware of, and expecting to fix next.
